1	a,"Even if my heart should cease to beat, my sword and honor shall live forever!"\r\n\r\nFighters possess superior strength and dexterity. They pride themselves as being the most skilled in close-range physical combat, mainly using swords and other handheld weapons.  They may also choose to focus on long-range attacks to develop into archers later in their careers. If you desire fierce combat and a brutish, ravaging lifestyle, either by sword or arrow, select the way of the Fighter.\0
2	a,"Burn, burn bright, my fierce white flames. Illuminate the darkness and destroy those who dare to attack us."\r\n\r\nMages follow the path of sorcery, and may summon magical creatures, cure grievous wounds, cast powerful attack spells, and create other wondrous miracles through their study of magic. Choose the way of the Mage if you prefer to harness mighty elemental forces with the power of your intellect, rather than fighting by swinging clumsy steel.\0
3	a,"My blade sings like the wind and will carry you to a place of eternal peace, where tranquil waters run soft into the great ocean."\r\n\r\nDelicate, willowy, and graceful, Elven Fighters are adept warriors that practice precise, deadly swordsmanship. The mere sight of them wielding their long, slender whip-like swords has led some scholars to call it the "beautiful dance."\0
4	a,"Spirits, I seek the aid that was promised, forged in the pact of our friendship, solemnly sworn in the year of my birth!"\r\n\r\nMagic runs deep in the blood of the Elves, and as such the Elven Magicians are perhaps the mightiest sorcerers in Aden. They focus on the strength of their mind, possibly to the detriment of their constitution, and therefore may be weak in physical combat. Yet their command of the elemental forces makes them formidable opponents.\0
5	a,"Quiet. Why do you talk so much? There's no need for strategy or plans-you need just slay the enemy without a word."\r\n\r\nDark Elf Fighters are dangerous close-combat fighters who rely on their speed and agility to give them an edge in battle. Letting down one's guard when facing them may lead to a quick and painful death from their flashing cold blades.\0
6	a,"I call upon the awesome energies of the great Gran Kain to annihilate my enemies and erase their names from the world!"\r\n\r\nDark Elf Mystics are infamous for their ability to command dark magic. They relish  their powerful attack spells that can smite an enemy with a single word. Some say that their innate magical abilities surpass even those of the Elves.\0
7	a,"You fools dare to block my path?! Do you truly believe that your puny bodies and those flimsy scraps of metal will withstand my attack?"\r\n\r\nNo one can match the might of an Orc Fighter when it comes to pure physical strength. With their unflagging endurance and their incredible stubbornness, they are a fearful presence on the battlefield that no one wishes to face.\0
8	a,"In the name of the eternal fire, may our enemies be burned, boiled, and roasted! Scour them mercilessly with flame, and drive them from our path!"\r\n\r\nFar from the front lines, Orc Mages have always cast their spells from the shadows. Their command of sinister magic has given them tremendous political influence within Orc society. Even though they are physically tougher than Mages of other races, most believe their magic effects to be weaker.\0
9	a,"I'll fight when I have to. Lemme see that sword. Hmm. Good balance, fine work. Listen, fetch me a drink and let me tell you the history of this fine blade."\r\n\r\nDwarven Fighters are good solid fighters, but they are more renowned for their excellent \r\ncraftsmanship, scavenging abilities, and trade skills. Dwarfs work tirelessly to create wondrous objects, and strive with each other to earn a reputation as the greatest trader in the land.\0
10	a,"My proof is not the number of my victories, nor the power by which I crushed my enemies... it is the razor sharp blade of my sword."\r\n\r\nKamael soldiers are warriors who fight using both sword and magic. If you wish to play a male character, choose the Berserker, whose explosive nature complements his raw power. If you prefer quick movements and powerful strikes, choose a Kamael soldier!\0
11	a,"In a battlefield filled with blood and death, my noble wings will purify all."\r\n\r\nKamael soldiers are warriors who fight using both sword and magic. Female characters can choose to become an Arbalester, who hunts using traps and deception. If you wish to be a valuable team player with elegant moves, choose a female Kamael soldier!\0
