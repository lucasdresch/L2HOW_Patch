1000053	a,According to the command of Beleth... I'm going to observe you guys!\0
1000054	a,You people make me sick! No sense of loyalty whatsoever!\0
1000055	a,A challenge against me is the same as a challenge against Beleth...\0
1000056	a,Beleth is always watching over you guys!\0
1000057	a,That was really close! Antharas opened its eyes!\0
1000058	a,You who disobey the will of Antharas! Die!\0

1000069	a,There really are still lots of folks in the world without fear! I'll teach you a lesson!\0
1000070	a,If you hand over everything you've got, I'll at least spare your life!\0

1000076	a,Present the lives of four people to Antharas!\0
1000077	a,This is unbelievable! How could I have lost to one so inferior to myself?\0
1000078	a,I carry the power of darkness and have returned from the abyss.\0
1000079	a,It's detestable.\0
1000080	a,I finally find rest...\0

1000086	a,I will kill with my own hands anyone that defiles our home!\0
1000087	a,My brothers will never rest until we push you and your gang out of this valley!\0
1000088	a,Until the day of destruction of Hestui!\0
1000089	a,If any intrepid Orcs remain, attack them!\0
1000090	a,I'll break your windpipe!\0
1000091	a,Is revenge a failure?!\0
1000092	a,The sparkling mithril of the dwarves and their pretty treasures! I'll get them all!\0
1000093	a,Where are all the dreadful dwarves and their sparkling things?\0
1000094	a,Hand over your pretty treasures!\0
1000095	a,Hey! You should have run away!\0
1000096	a,DESTRUCTION - EXTINCTION - SLAUGHTER - COLLAPSE! DESTRUCTION - EXTINCTION - SLAUGHTER - COLLAPSE!\0
1000097	a,Destruction! Destruction! Destruction! Destruction!\0

1000101	a,Whew! He's quite a guy!\0
1000102	a,How exasperating and unfair to have things happen in such a meaningless way like this...\0
1000103	a,This world should be filled with fear and sadness...\0
1000104	a,I won't forgive the world that cursed me!\0
1000105	a,I'll make everyone feel the same suffering as me!\0
1000106	a,I'll give you a curse that you'll never be able to remove forever!\0
1000107	a,I'll get revenge on you who slaughtered my compatriots!\0
1000108	a,Those who are afraid should get away and those who are brave should fight!\0
1000109	a,I've got power from Beleth so do you think I'll be easily defeated?!\0
1000110	a,I am leaving now, but soon someone will come who will teach you all a lesson!\0
1000111	a,Hey guys, let's make a round of our territory!\0
1000112	a,The rumor is that there are wild, uncivilized ruffians who have recently arrived in my territory.\0
1000113	a,Do you know who I am?! I am Sirocco! Everyone, attack!\0
1000114	a,What's just happened?! The invincible Sirocco was defeated by someone like you?!\0
1000115	a,Oh, I'm really hungry...\0
1000116	a,I smell food. Ooh...\0
1000117	a,Ooh...\0
1000118	a,What does honey of this place taste like?!\0
1000119	a,Give me some sweet, delicious golden honey!\0
1000120	a,If you give me some honey, I'll at least spare your life...\0
1000121	a,Only for lack of honey did I lose to the likes of you.\0
1000122	a,Where is the traitor Kuroboros!?\0
1000123	a,Look in every nook and cranny around here!\0
1000124	a,Are you Lackey of Kuroboros?! I'll knock you out in one shot!\0
1000125	a,He just closed his eyes without disposing of the traitor... How unfair!\0
1000126	a,Hell for unbelievers in Kuroboros!\0
1000127	a,The person that does not believe in kuroboros, his life will soon become hell!\0
1000128	a,The lackey of that demented devil, the servant of a false god! I'll send that fool straight to hell!\0
1000129	a,Uh... I'm not dying; I'm just disappearing for a moment... I'll resurrect again!\0
1000130	a,Hail to Kuroboros, the founder of our religion!\0
1000131	a,Only those who believe in Patriarch Kuroboros shall receive salvation!\0
1000132	a,Are you the ones that Sharuk has incited?! You also should trust in Kuroboros and be saved!\0
1000133	a,Kuroboros will punish you.\0
1000134	a,You who have beautiful spirits that shine brightly! I have returned!\0
1000135	a,You that are weary and exhausted... Entrust your souls to me.\0
1000136	a,The color of your soul is very attractive.\0
1000137	a,Those of you who live! Do you know how beautiful your souls are?!\0
1000138	a,It... will... kill... everyone...\0
1000139	a,I'm... so... lonely...\0
1000140	a,My... enemy...!\0
1000141	a,... Now... I'm not so lonely!\0
1000142	a,I will never forgive the Pixy Murika... that is trying to... kill us!\0
1000143	a,Attack all the dull and stupid followers of Murika!\0
1000144	a,I didn't have any idea about such ambitions!\0
1000145	a,This is not the end... It's just the beginning.\0
1000146	a,Hey... Shall we have some fun for the first time in a long while?...\0
1000147	a,There've been some things going around like crazy here recently...\0
1000148	a,Hey! Do you know who I am? I am Malex, Herald of Dagoniel! Attack!\0
1000149	a,What's just happened?! The invincible Malex just lost to the likes of you?!\0
1000150	a,It's something repeated in a vain life...\0
1000151	a,Shake in fear, all you who value your lives!\0
1000152	a,I'll make you feel suffering like a flame that is never extinguished!\0
1000153	a,Back to the dirt...\0
1000154	a,Hail Varika!!\0
1000155	a,Nobody can stop us!\0
1000156	a,You move slowly!\0
1000157	a,Varika! Go first!\0
1000158	a,Where am I? Who am I?\0
1000159	a,Uh... My head hurts like it's going to burst! Who am I?\0
1000160	a,You jerk. You're a devil! You're a devil to have made me like this!\0
1000161	a,Where am I? What happened? Thank you!\0
1000162	a,Ukru Master!\0

1000181	a,Sacred magical research is conducted here.\0
1000182	a,Behold the awesome power of magic!\0
1000183	a,Your powers are impressive but you must not annoy our high level sorcerer.\0
1000184	a,I am Barda, master of the Bandit Stronghold!\0
1000185	a,I, Master Barda, once owned that stronghold,\0
1000186	a,Ah, very interesting!\0
1000187	a,You are more powerful than you appear. We'll meet again!\0
1000188	a,You filthy sorcerers disgust me!\0
1000189	a,Why would you build a tower in our territory?\0
1000190	a,Are you part of that evil gang of sorcerers?\0
1000191	a,That is why I don't bother with anyone below the level of sorcerer.\0
1000192	a,Ah, another beautiful day!\0
1000193	a,Our specialties are arson and looting.\0
1000194	a,You will leave empty-handed!\0
1000195	a,Ah, so you admire my treasure, do you? Try finding it! Ha!\0
1000196	a,Is everybody listening? Sirion has come back. Everyone chant and bow...\0
1000197	a,Bow down, you worthless humans!\0
1000198	a,Very tacky!\0
1000199	a,Don't think that you are invincible just because you defeated me!\0
1000200	a,The material desires of mortals are ultimately meaningless.\0
1000201	a,Do not forget the reason the Tower of Insolence collapsed.\0
1000202	a,You humans are all alike, full of greed and avarice!\0
1000203	a,All for nothing,\0
1000204	a,What are all these people doing here?\0
1000205	a,I must find the secret of eternal life, here among these rotten angels!\0
1000206	a,Do you also seek the secret of immortality?\0
1000207	a,I shall never reveal my secrets!\0
1000208	a,Who dares enter this place?\0
1000209	a,This is no place for humans! You must leave immediately.\0
1000210	a,You poor creatures! Too stupid to realize your own ignorance!\0
1000211	a,You mustn't go there!\0
1000212	a,Who dares disturb this marsh?\0
1000213	a,The humans must not be allowed to destroy the marshland for their greedy purposes.\0
1000214	a,You are a brave man...\0
1000215	a,You idiots! Some day you shall also be gone!\0
1000216	a,Someone has entered the forest...\0
1000217	a,The forest is very quiet and peaceful.\0
1000218	a,Stay here in this wonderful forest!\0
1000219	a,My... my souls...\0
1000220	a,This forest is a dangerous place.\0
1000221	a,Unless you leave this forest immediately you are bound to run into serious trouble.\0
1000222	a,Leave now!\0
1000223	a,Why do you ignore my warning?\0
1000224	a,Harits of the world... I bring you peace!\0
1000225	a,Harits! Be courageous!\0
1000226	a,I shall eat your still-beating heart!.\0
1000227	a,Harits! Keep faith until the day I return... Never lose hope!\0
1000228	a,Even the giants are gone! There's nothing left to be afraid of now!\0
1000229	a,Have you heard of the giants? Their downfall was inevitable!\0
1000230	a,What nerve! Do you dare to challenge me?\0
1000231	a,You are as evil as the giants...\0
1000232	a,This dungeon is still in good condition!\0
1000233	a,This place is spectacular, wouldn't you say?\0
1000234	a,You are very brave warriors!\0
1000235	a,Are the giants truly gone for good?\0
1000236	a,These graves are good.\0
1000237	a,Gold and silver are meaningless to a dead man!\0
1000238	a,Why would those corrupt aristocrats bury such useful things?\0
1000239	a,You filthy pig! Eat and be merry now that you have shirked your responsibilities!\0
1000240	a,Those thugs! It would be too merciful to rip them apart and chew them up one at a time!\0
1000241	a,You accursed scoundrels!\0
1000242	a,Hmm, could this be the assassin sent by those idiots from Aden?\0
1000243	a,I shall curse your name with my last breath!\0
1000244	a,My beloved Lord Shilen.\0
1000245	a,I must break the seal and release Lord Shilen as soon as possible...\0
1000246	a,You shall taste the vengeance of Lord Shilen!\0
1000247	a,Lord Shilen... some day... you will accomplish... this mission...\0
1000248	a,Towards immortality...\0
1000249	a,He who desires immortality... Come unto me.\0
1000250	a,You shall be sacrificed to gain my immortality!\0
1000251	a,Eternal life in front of my eyes... I have collapsed in such a worthless way like this...\0
1000252	a,Zaken, you are a cowardly cur!\0
1000253	a,You are immortal, aren't you, Zaken?\0
1000254	a,Please return my body to me.\0
1000255	a,Finally... will I be able to rest?\0
1000256	a,What is all that racket?\0
1000257	a,Master Gildor does not like to be disturbed.\0
1000258	a,Please, just hold it down...\0
1000259	a,If you disturb Master Gildor I won't be able to help you.\0
1000260	a,Who dares approach?\0
1000261	a,These reeds are my territory...\0
1000262	a,You fools! Today you shall learn a lesson!\0
1000263	a,The past goes by... Is a new era beginning?...\0
1000264	a,This is the garden of Eva.\0
1000265	a,The garden of Eva is a sacred place.\0
1000266	a,Do you mean to insult Eva?\0
1000267	a,How rude!  Eva's love is available to all, even to an ill-mannered lout like yourself!\0
1000268	a,This place once belonged to Lord Shilen.\0
1000269	a,Leave this palace to us, spirits of Eva.\0
1000270	a,Why are you getting in our way?\0
1000271	a,Shilen... our Shilen!\0
1000272	a,All who fear of Fafurion... Leave this place at once!\0
1000273	a,You are being punished in the name of Fafurion!\0
1000274	a,Oh, master... please forgive your humble servant...\0
1000275	a,Prepare to die, foreign invaders! I am Gustav, the eternal ruler of this fortress and I have taken up my sword to repel thee!\0
1000276	a,Glory to Aden, the Kingdom of the Lion! Glory to Sir Gustav, our immortal lord!\0
1000277	a,Soldiers of Gustav, go forth and destroy the invaders!\0
1000278	a,This is unbelievable! Have I really been defeated? I shall return and take your head!\0
1000279	a,Could it be that I have reached my end? I cannot die without honor, without the permission of Sir Gustav!\0
1000280	a,Ah, the bitter taste of defeat... I fear my torments are not over...\0
1000281	a,I follow the will of Fafurion.\0

2150	a,Who awoke me?\0
2250	a,Did you call me, $s1?\0
2251	a,I'm confused! Maybe it's time to go back.\0
2550	a,That box was sealed by my master, $s1! Don't touch it!\0
2551	a,You've ended my immortal life! You're protected by the feudal lord, aren't you?\0
2450	a,That sign!\0
7050	a,You made it here, $s1. I'll show my strength. Die! \0
7051	a,Ha! You failed! Are you ready to quit?\0
7052	a,I'm the strongest! I lost everything to win!\0
7053	a,$s1! Are you doing this because they're Halisha's minions?\0
7054	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7055	a,Mind your own business!\0
7056	a,This fight is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0
7057	a,Every cloud has a silver lining, don't you think?\0
7058	a,$s1! Don't listen to this demon.\0
7059	a,$s1! Hesitation betrays your heart. Fight!\0
7060	a,$s1! Isn't protecting somebody worthy? Isn't that justice?\0
7061	a,I have urgent business! I gotta go.\0
7062	a,Are my efforts in vain? Is this the end?\0
7063	a,Goodbye, friend. I hope to see you again.\0
7064	a,Knights are always foolish!\0
7065	a,I'll show mercy on you for now.\0
7066	a,$s1! Your justice is just hypocrisy if you give up on what you've promised to protect.\0
7067	a,$s1...Don't think you've won! Your dark shadow will always follow you...hypocrite!\0
7150	a,A temple knight guards the Mother Tree! $s1! Has Human contact made you forget that?\0
7151	a,I must stop. Remember, the ones you're protecting will someday defeat the Elves.\0
7152	a,What! That will just strengthen the enemy!\0
7153	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7154	a,My spirit is releasing from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7155	a,Mind your own business!\0
7156	a,This is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0
7157	a,I'm not like my brother Panacea. Ghost of the past, begone!\0
7158	a,The Elves no longer rule! Help me, $s1!\0
7159	a,Don't give up, $s1! He' a demon from the past!\0
7160	a,Be proud, $s1. We protect this world together.\0
7161	a,I have to go. I've got some business to take care of.\0
7162	a,Ugh! Don't let him get away!\0
7163	a,Don't forget your pride. You're protecting the world!\0
7164	a,Ha, ha, ha!...\0
7165	a,Kuh, huh...\0
7166	a,Aah! Kuh...$s1!...Kuh, huh...\0
7167	a,$s1!...Re... mem... Ugh...Uh...\0
7250	a,$s1, You'd better listen.\0
7251	a,Huh? It's curtain time! I won't get any money.\0
7252	a,Ugh...It can't be...!\0
7253	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7254	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7255	a,Mind your own business!\0
7256	a,This is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0
7257	a,You won't get away this time, Narcissus!\0
7258	a,$s1! Help me!\0
7259	a,You must be aware of your audience when singing, %s! => Join us $s1! A song that nobody listens to is empty.\0
7260	a,You must work harder to be victorious, $s1.\0
7261	a,My song is over, I must go. Goodbye!\0
7262	a,How could I miss!\0
7263	a,Don't forget. Song comes with harmony.\0
7264	a,Sing. Everyone will listen.\0
7265	a,You don't deserve my blessing.\0
7266	a,Do you reject my blessing, $s1?\0
7267	a,But why, $s1. Everyone would praise you!\0
7350	a,$s1! Attack me? I'm immortal! I'm unrivaled!\0
7351	a,Ha! I'm immortal. This scar will soon heal. You'll die next time.\0
7352	a,Metellus! You promised me an immortal life! How could I, Swordmaster Iron, lose?\0
7353	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7354	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7355	a,Mind your own business!\0
7356	a,This is a waste of time... Goodbye!\0
7357	a,Fallen Angel? It's worth trying.\0
7358	a,Hey $s1! Why don't you join? It's your best shot!\0
7359	a,Are you interested in immortal life, $s1? It's too boring for me.\0
7360	a,Excellent, $s1! Show me what you learned when your life was on the line!\0
7361	a,I have to go take a break.\0
7362	a,You missed?! What a fool you are!\0
7363	a,Fighting without risk, training without danger and growing without hardship will only lead to an inflated ego. Don't forget.\0
7364	a,Do you want an immortal life?\0
7365	a,Think it over. An immortal life and assured victory...\0
7366	a,That's good, $s1! Do you want my blessing to improve your skills?\0
7367	a,$s1! Why do you reject guaranteed victory?\0
7450	a,In the name of gods, I punish you, $s1! You can't rival us all, no matter how strong you think you are!\0
7451	a,I have to stop for now, but I'll defeat the power of the dragon yet!\0
7452	a,It is...The power that shouldn't live!\0
7453	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7454	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7455	a,Mind your own business!\0
7456	a,This is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0
7457	a,Isn't it unwise for an angel to interfere in Human affairs?\0
7458	a,This is tough! $s1, would you help me?\0
7459	a,$s1! He's keeping an eye on all those in succession to the blood of dragons, including you!\0
7460	a,Attack the rear, $s1! If I'm killed, you're next!\0
7461	a,I can't stay any longer. There are too many eyes on us. Farewell!\0
7462	a,Get away? You're still alive. But...\0
7463	a,If we can't avoid this fight, we'll need great strength. It's the only way to peace.\0
7464	a,Warlord, you'll never learn the techniques of the dragon!\0
7465	a,Hey, why bother with this. Isn't it your mother's business?\0
7466	a,$s1! Are you against your mother's wishes? You're not worthy of the secrets of Shilen's children!\0
7467	a,Excellent technique, $s1. Unfortunately, you're the one destined for tragedy!\0
7550	a,$s1! You may follow me, but an Orc is no match for my giant's strength!\0
7551	a,Kuh...My body fails..This is the end!\0
7552	a,How could I lose with the powers of a giant? Aargh!!!\0
7553	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7554	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7555	a,Mind your own business!\0
7556	a,This is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0
7557	a,That's the enemy.\0
7558	a,Hmm.. $s1! Will you just stand there doing nothing?\0
7559	a,$s1. Nothing risked, nothing gained. Only those who fight enjoy the spoils of victory.\0
7560	a,A sword isn't jewelry, $s1. Don't you agree?\0
7561	a,With no fight, I have no reason to stay.\0
7562	a,Miss...\0
7563	a,Pick your battles wisely, or you'll regret it.\0
7564	a,What a fool to challenge the giant of the Oroka tribe!\0
7565	a,Running low on steam. I must withdraw.\0
7566	a,$s1. You're the one who defeated Guardian Muhark!\0
7567	a,$s1....! I must succeed...\0
7650	a,$s1... Would you fight Uruz, who has reached the power of Azira?\0
7651	a,I can't handle the power of Azira yet. First...\0
7652	a,This can't be happening! I have the power of Azira! How could I fall so easily?\0
7653	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7654	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7655	a,Mind your own business!\0
7656	a,This is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0
7657	a,Azira, born from the Evil Flame, I'll kill you with my bare hands!\0
7658	a,$s1! In the name of Khavatari Hubai, strike this evil with your fists!\0
7659	a,$s1! Attack from both sides! Hit hard!\0
7660	a,$s1! Strike with all your heart. It must work.\0
7661	a,Damn! It's time to go. Until next time.\0
7662	a,Evil spirit of flame! I won't give up!\0
7663	a,My fist works even on the evil spirit. Don't forget!\0
7664	a,Foolish Khavatari...Do you think your power will work on me? I'm the source of your martial art!\0
7665	a,No more games...\0
7666	a,$s1...Are you next after Khavatari? Do you know who I am?\0
7667	a,$s1...Kashu. Not a bad attack. I can't hold on much longer.\0
7750	a,$s1, Akkan, you can't be my rival! I'll kill everything! I'll be the king!\0
7751	a,Ha! I'll show mercy on you this time. I know well of your technique!\0
7752	a,I have in me the blood of a king! How could I lose?!\0
7753	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7754	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7755	a,Mind your own business!\0
7756	a,This is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0
7757	a,Are you....tyrant!\0
7758	a,You're not a king! You're just a tyrant! $s1, we must fight together!\0
7759	a,Such rule is ruining the country! $s1, I can't bear this tyranny any longer!\0
7760	a,$s1, leaders must always resist tyranny!\0
7761	a,I stayed too long. I'll be punished for being away so long.\0
7762	a,He got away, Dammit! We must catch this dark soul!\0
7763	a,What is a king? What must one do to be a good king? Think it over.\0
7764	a,Kneel down before me! Foolish people!\0
7765	a,It's time for the king to leave! Bow your head and say goodbye!\0
7766	a,$s1! You dare to fight me? A king's power must be great to rule!\0
7767	a,You would fight the king, $s1? Traitor!\0
7850	a,Tejakar Sharuhi! $s1, I'll show you the power of Sharuhi Mouth Mudaha!\0
7851	a,Aaargh! My soul won't keep quiet. Now I must take my leave.\0
7852	a,No, Sharuhi. You're soul is mine!\0
7853	a,You dare to disturb the order of the shrine! Die, $s1!\0
7854	a,My spirit is released from this shell. I'm getting close to Halisha...\0
7855	a,Mind your own business!\0
7856	a,This is a waste of time. Goodbye!\0
7857	a,Tejakar Oroca! Tejakar Duda-Mara!\0
7858	a,$s1, we must fight this soul together to prevent an everlasting winter!\0
7859	a,$s1! The soul responds to you. May your attack quiet him!\0
7860	a,$s1! Calm Sharuhi! He doesn't listen to me anymore.\0
7861	a,It's time to go! May the eternal flame bless you!\0
7862	a,He left...That's too bad..Too bad...\0
7863	a,Don't forget your strong will now!\0
7864	a,Ha! Nobody will rule over me anymore!\0
7865	a,Freedom... freedom... freedom!\0
7866	a,$s1, You released me, but you also want to catch me. Ha!\0
7867	a,...$s1...Me?....All right...I'll help you.\0
7950	a,Get out of here! This place is forbidden by god.\0
7951	a,Einhasad is calling me.\0
7952	a,You killed me! Aren't you afraid of god's curse?\0
7953	a,You bother my minions, $s1. Do you want to die?\0
7954	a,What the hell... I lost.\0
7955	a,Who are you? Why are you interfering in our business?\0
7956	a,You're strong. I'll get you next time!\0
7957	a,We meet again. I'll have you this time!\0
7958	a,A worthy opponent. $s1. Help me!\0
7959	a,$s1! Hurry before he gets away!\0
7960	a,I'll kill you!\0
7961	a,Why don't you fight me someday?\0
7962	a,I missed again. Dammit!\0
7963	a,I'm sure we'll meet again someday.\0
7964	a,Curse those who defy the gods!\0
7965	a,Einhasad is calling me.\0
7966	a,You would fight me, a messenger of the gods?\0
7967	a,$s1! I won't forget you.\0
8050	a,$s1! How could you desecrate a holy place?\0
8051	a,Leave before you are severely punished!\0
8052	a,Einhasad, don't give up on me!\0
8053	a,$s1, so you're the one who's looking for me?\0
8054	a,A mere mortal has defeated me!\0
8055	a,How cowardly to intrude in other people's business.\0
8056	a,Time is up.\0
8057	a,I'll kill you with my sword!\0
8058	a,Help me!\0
8059	a,Don't miss!\0
8060	a,Keep pushing!\0
8061	a,I'll get him. You'll have your revenge.\0
8062	a,I missed him again. I'll kill you.\0
8063	a,I must follow him.\0
8064	a,Curse those who defy the gods!\0
8065	a,Einhasad is calling me.\0
8066	a,You would fight me, a messenger of the gods?\0
8067	a,$s1! I won't forget you.\0
8150	a,$s1, you should leave if you fear god's wrath!\0
8151	a,What's going on?\0
8152	a,I'll see you again!\0
8153	a,Who are you? Why are you bothering my minions?\0
8154	a,No way!!!\0
8155	a,Why are you sticking your nose in our business?\0
8156	a,Who are you? How can a creature from the netherworld be so powerful?\0
8157	a,Is this the end?\0
8158	a,Show me what you're made of. Kill him!\0
8159	a,You think you can get him with that?\0
8160	a,Pull yourself together! He's trying to get away.\0

1800970	a,Strike with music~! Not with something like this. You need music~!\0
1800971	a,You're pretty amazing~! But it's all for nothing~~!\0
1800972	a,Use that on monsters, OK? I want Crono~!\0

1801057	a,Let's learn about the Jack's game together~! You can play with me 3 times.\0
1801058	a,Let's start! Show the card you want! The card skill is attached to the mask.\0
1801059	a,You showed the same card as me, so you win.\0
1801060	a,You showed a different card from me, so you lose.\0
1801061	a,That was practice, so there's no candy even if you win~\0
1801062	a,It's unfortunate. Let's practice one more time.\0
1801063	a,You gotta show the card at the right time. Use the card skill you want before the gauge above my head disappears!\0
1801064	a,The card skills are attached to the Jack O'Lantern mask, right? That's what you use.\0
1801065	a,You win if you show the same card as me, and I win if the cards are different. OK, let's go~\0
1801066	a,You didn't show a card again? We'll try again later. I'm gonna go now~\0
1801067	a,Now, do you understand a little about Jack's game? The real game's with Uldie and Belldandy. Well, see you later!\0

1801073	a,Annoying concentration attacks overwhelmed Valakas, making it forget its rage and become distracted!\0
1801074	a,Long-range concentration attacks have enraged Valakas!\\nIf you continue, it may become a dangerous situation!\0
1801075	a,Because the cowardly counterattacks continued, Valakas's fury has reached its maximum!\\nValakas's P. Atk. is greatly increased!\0
1801076	a,Valakas has been enraged by the long-range concentration attacks and is coming toward its target with even greater zeal!\0
1801077	a,Listen, oh Tantas! I have returned! The Prophet Yugoros of the Black Abyss is with me, so do not be afraid!\0
1801078	a,Welcome, $s1! Let us see if you have brought a worthy offering for the Black Abyss!\0
1801079	a,What a formidable foe! But I have the Abyss Weed given to me by the Black Abyss! Let me see...\0
1801080	a,Muhahaha! Ah, this burning sensation in my mouth! The power of the Black Abyss is reviving me!\0
1801081	a,No! How dare you stop me from using the Abyss Weed... Do you know what you have done?!\0
1801082	a,A limp creature like this is unworthy to be an offering... You have no right to sacrifice to the Black Abyss!\0
1801083	a,Listen, oh Tantas! The Black Abyss is famished! Find some fresh offerings!\0
1801084	a,Ah... How could I lose... Oh, Black Abyss, receive me...\0

1801190	a,Even though you bring something called a gift among your humans, it would just be problematic for me...\0
1801191	a,I just don't know what expression I should have it appeared on me. Are human's emotions like this feeling?\0
1801192	a,The feeling of thanks is just too much distant memory for me...\0
1801193	a,But I kind of miss it... Like I had felt this feeling before...\0
1801194	a,I am Ice Queen Freya... This feeling and emotion are nothing but a part of Melissa'a memories.\0
1801195	a,Dear $s1... Think of this as my appreciation for the gift. Take this with you. There's nothing strange about it. It's just a bit of my capriciousness...\0
1801196	a,The kindness of somebody is not a bad feeling... Dear $s1, I will take this gift out of respect your kindness.\0

1900056	a,Even pros can't do this much. You're amazing.\0
1900057	a,Who's the monster here?! This time, I'll bet my precious Transformation Stick.\0

1900069	a,This is the highest record in my life! Next time, I'll give you my treasure -- the Golden Jack O'Lantern!\0
1900070	a,Even pros can't do 14 wins in a row...! Next time, I'll give you my treasure, the Golden Jack O'Lantern.\0
1900071	a,I can't do this anymore! You win! In all my 583 years, you're the best that I've seen!\0
1900072	a,Playing any more is meaningless. You were my greatest opponent.\0

1900074	a,I won this round. It was enjoyable.\0
1900075	a,Above world people are so fun...! Then, see you later!\0

1900081	a,%s has won %s Jack's games in a row.\0
1900082	a,Congratulations! %s has won %s Jack's games in a row.\0
1900083	a,Congratulations on getting 1st place in Jack's game!\0
1900084	a,Hello~! I'm Belldandy. Congratulations on getting 1st place in Jack's game. If you go and find my sibling Skooldie in the village, you'll get an amazing gift! Let's play Jack's game again!\0
1900085	a,Hmm. You're playing Jack's game for the first time, huh? You couldn't even take out your card at the right time~! My goodness...\0
1900086	a,Oh. You're not very familiar with Jack's game, right? You didn't take out your card at the right time...\0
1900087	a,You have to use the card skill on the mask before the gauge above my head disappears.\0
1900088	a,You must use the card skill on the mask before the gauge above my head disappears.\0
1900089	a,If you show the same card as me, you win. If they're different, I win. Understand? Now, let's go!\0
1900090	a,You will win if you show the same card as me. It's my victory if the cards are different. Well, let's start again~\0
1900091	a,Ack! You didn't show a card? You have to use the card skill before the gauge disappears. Hmph. Then, I'm going.\0
1900092	a,Ahh. You didn't show a card. You must use the card skill at the right time. It's unfortunate. Then, I will go now~\0
1900093	a,Let's learn about the Jack's game together~! You can play with me 3 times.\0
1900094	a,Let's start! Show the card you want! The card skill is attached to the mask.\0
1900095	a,You showed the same card as me, so you win.\0
1900096	a,You showed a different card from me, so you lose.\0
1900097	a,That was practice, so there's no candy even if you win~\0
1900098	a,It's unfortunate. Let's practice one more time.\0
1900099	a,You gotta show the card at the right time. Use the card skill you want before the gauge above my head disappears!\0
1900100	a,The card skills are attached to the Jack O'Lantern mask, right? That's what you use.\0
1900101	a,You win if you show the same card as me, and I win if the cards are different. OK, let's go~\0
1900102	a,You didn't show a card again? We'll try again later. I'm gonna go now~\0
1900103	a,Now, do you understand a little about Jack's game? The real game's with Uldie and Belldandy. Well, see you later!\0
1900104	a,Yawn~ Ahh... Hello~! Nice weather we're having.\0

1900130	a,%s. Thank you.\0
1900131	a,Hahaha!!! I captured Santa Claus!! Huh? Where is this? Who are you?\0
1900132	a,...I lost at Rock Paper Scissors and was taken captive... I might as well take out my anger on you! Huh~ What?\0
1900133	a,Nothing's working... I'm leaving! I'll definitely capture Santa again! Just you wait!\0
1900134	a,I must raise Rudolph quickly. This year's Christmas gifts have to be delivered...\0
