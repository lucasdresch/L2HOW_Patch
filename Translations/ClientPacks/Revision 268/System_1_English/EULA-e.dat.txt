Due to the fact that this communication channel has the ability to impact every player on the server, NC Interactive will not tolerate any inappropriate behavior of any sort in this chat channel. This includes but is not limited to: inappropriate language of any sort or any attempt to escape the profanity filter, inappropriate or vulgar content of any sort, repeated ‘spamming,’ or ‘flooding’ of the global chat channel, or any other conduct determined to be inappropriate by NC Interactive Support, in its sole discretion. Any violation of this term or rules of conduct may, in the sole discretion of NC Interactive, lead to the temporary removal of the character’s ability to communicate, the Account being suspended for a set period of time, or lead to permanent Account closure.  We may record or monitor the chat to assist us in this process.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. SERVICE FEE; ADDITIONAL FEATURE PURCHASES \r\n\r\n(a) Our fees and billing procedures are published in the registration section of the Web Site, which are incorporated herein by this reference.

The duration of the free trial period will be published in the registration section of the Web Site. Any person who has been a Member is not eligible for any subsequent free trial period.  You represent to NC Interactive that you are the authorized account holder or an authorized user of the chosen method of payment used to pay the Account fee or price for the Additional Feature, as applicable. You agree to promptly notify NC Interactive of any changes to your account number, its expiration date and/or your billing address, and you agree to promptly notify NC Interactive if your account expires or is cancelled for any reason. \r\n\r\n(b) YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO MAKE ANY CHARGE BACK OR OTHERWISE RECLAIM OR OBTAIN A REFUND OF OR A CREDIT AGAINST ANY FEES PAID WITHOUT FIRST CLOSING YOUR GAME ACCOUNT OR HAVING OBTAINED NC INTERACTIVE’S PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT TO SUCH REFUND SHALL ENTITLE NC INTERACTIVE TO DEACTIVATE YOUR GAME ACCOUNT AND ANY OTHER ACCOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH METHOD OF PAYMENT UNLESS NC INTERACTIVE CONSENTS IN WRITING FOLLOWING YOUR PAYMENT OF THE FEES OR A CREDIT OR REFUND IS AGREED IN WRITING WITH NC INTERACTIVE.

No notice will be provided for changes to the purchase price of Additional Features.  If you do not agree to any such alteration, you should terminate your Account prior to the date on which the alteration takes effect, otherwise the revised amount will automatically be debited to your Account.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. CONTENT AND MEMBER CONDUCT \r\n\r\n(a) Content. You acknowledge that: (i) by using the Software and the Service you will have access to graphics, sound effects, music, animation-style video, content, layout, design, files, data, characters (and items and attributes associated with characters), game objects and text (collectively, “Content”), and (ii) Content may be provided under license by independent content providers, including text contributions from other Members (all such independent content providers, “Content Providers”). NC Interactive does not pre-screen Content as a matter of policy. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT NC INTERACTIVE HAS THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO REMOVE ANY CONTENT (INCLUDING YOURS) IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON OR NO REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE AND WITH NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND. \r\n\r\n(b) Rights in Content. You acknowledge that NC Interactive and its related Game Content Providers (“Game Content Providers”) have rights in their respective Game Content under copyright and other applicable laws, and that you accept full responsibility and liability for your use of any Game Content in violation of any such rights. NC Interactive and its related Game Content Providers grant to Members the right to use the Game Content for noncommercial, personal purposes, including in connection with creating noncommercial fan fiction or fan web sites regarding the same. However, you acknowledge and agree that you shall not reproduce, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, publicly perform, or transmit any Game Content for commercial uses without first obtaining the express written consent of NC Interactive. \r\nFor clarification purposes only, “derivative works based upon” Game Content are works which are substantially similar, both in ideas and expression, to the Game Content. Similarity of ideas in the Game Content and derivative works concern similarities between things such as plot, theme, mood, setting, appearance, and character traits. Similarity of expression concerns the total concept and feel of the Game Content and the derivative works. Thus, if a work created by a Member or someone other than NC Interactive (or its related Game Content Providers) is likely to bring to mind the Game Content, then it is likely that such work is a derivative work of the Game Content, and as such may not be used for commercial purposes. \r\n\r\n(c) Member Content. Members can upload to and create content on our servers in various forms, such as in selections you make and characters and items you create for Lineage II, and in bulletin boards and similar user-to-user areas (“Member Content”). By submitting Member Content to or creating Member Content on any area of the Service, you acknowledge and agree that such Member Content is the sole property of NC Interactive. To the extent that NC Interactive cannot claim exclusive rights in Member Content by operation of law, you hereby grant (or you warrant that the owner of such Member Content has expressly granted) to NC Interactive and its related Game Content Providers a non-exclusive, universal, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicenseable right to exercise all rights of any kind or nature associated with such Member Content, and all ancillary and subsidiary rights thereto, in any languages and media now known or not currently known. You shall indemnify and hold NC Interactive and its affiliates\r\nharmless from and against any claims by third parties that your Member Content infringes upon, violates or misappropriates any of their intellectual property or proprietary rights. \r\n\r\n(d) Member Conduct. You agree not to use the Service to: (i) take any action or upload, post, e-mail or otherwise transmit any content that infringes or violates any third party rights; (ii) impersonate any person or entity, including, but not limited to, an NC Interactive or its affiliates’ employee, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity; (iii) take any action or upload, post, e-mail or otherwise transmit any content that violates any law or regulation; (iv) take any action or upload, post, e-mail or otherwise transmit any content as determined by NC Interactive at its sole discretion that is harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable; or contains any viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information; (v) take any action or upload, post, email or otherwise transmit any content that that could violate any right or duty under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as inside information, proprietary and confidential information learned or disclosed as part of employment relationships or under nondisclosure agreements); (vi) upload, post, email or otherwise transmit any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, “junk mail,” “spam,” “chain letters,” “pyramid schemes,” or any other form of solicitation; (vii) interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers or networks connected to the Service, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to the Service; (viii) attempt to gain access to any other user’s Account or password; or (ix) “stalk” or otherwise harass another member. \r\nYou agree that NC Interactive may take whatever steps it deems necessary to abridge, or prevent behavior of any sort on the Service in its sole discretion, without notice to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. OFFICIAL SERVICE\r\n\r\nNC Interactive has designed Lineage II for official play only as offered through the Service by NC Interactive at the Web Site and not through any other means. You further agree not to access, create or provide any other means through which Lineage II may be played by others, as through server emulators. You agree not to use any hardware or software, including but not limited to third party tools, or any other method of support which may in any way influence or advantage your use of the Service which is not authorized by NC Interactive, including but not limited to the use of ‘bots’ and/or any other method by which the Service may be played automatically without human input. You acknowledge that you do not have the right to create, publish, distribute, create derivative works from or use any software programs, utilities, applications, emulators or tools derived from or created for Lineage II, except that you may use the Software to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement. You may not take any action which imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure. \r\nYou may not sell or auction any Lineage II accounts, characters, items, currency or copyrighted material for real-world money or items or services of any value, nor may you assist others in doing so.  NC Interactive may from time to time in its sole discretion implement various forms of filtering, blocking or monitoring of IP addresses or proxies used to use, play or access the Game(s) or the Service, including without limitation blocking or filtering measures that restrict your ability to use, play or access Lineage II or Service outside of the territories in which NC Interactive makes Lineage II or Service available.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. PRIVACY \r\n\r\nOur privacy policy, which covers the usage and protection of your personal information, is published on the Web Site, currently at http://www.lineage2.com/legal/policy.html, and is incorporated herein by this reference. NC Interactive will maintain records of your “chats” using MSN messenger (the “Messenger Chat Logs”). Microsoft® Corporation has its own policies, which we do not control, and thus are not controlled by our privacy policy. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policy of this company. The Messenger Chat Logs will not be disclosed to third parties, except as set forth in our privacy policy. \r\n\r\n\r\n9. PARENTAL GUIDANCE \r\n\r\nWhile NC Interactive may choose to monitor and take action upon inappropriate game play, chat or links to the Service, it is possible that at any time there may be language or other material accessible on or through the Service that may be inappropriate for children or offensive to some users of any age. NC Interactive cannot ensure that other players will not provide Content or access to Content that parents or guardians may find inappropriate or that any user may find objectionable. NC Interactive does not as a matter of policy pre-screen the content of the materials or communications transmitted by each player. \r\nNC Interactive reserves the right to enforce any or all of these rules at its sole discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE \r\n\r\n(a) NC Interactive reserves the right to interrupt the Service from time to time on a regularly scheduled basis or otherwise with or without prior notice in order to perform maintenance.  You agree that NC Interactive will not be liable for any interruption of the Service, delay or failure to perform resulting from any causes whatsoever.\r\n\r\n(b) You acknowledge that the Service may be interrupted for reasons beyond the control of NC Interactive, and NC Interactive cannot guarantee that you will be able to access the Service or your Account whenever you may wish to do so. NC Interactive shall not be liable for any interruption of the Service, delay or failure to perform resulting from any causes whatsoever. \r\n\r\n(c) NC Interactive has the right at any time for any reason or no reason to change and/or eliminate any aspect(s) of the Service as it sees fit in its sole discretion.\r\n\r\n(d) NC Interactive shall not be obligated to refund all or any portion of any Account fee or Additional Feature fee by reason of any interruption of the Service by reason of any of the circumstances described in paragraph (a) or (b).\r\n\r\n\r\n11.

Without limiting the foregoing, NC Interactive does not ensure continuous, error-free, secure or virus-free operation of the Service, the Software, your Account or Lineage II, and you understand that you shall not be entitled to any refunds for fees based on NC Interactive’s failure to provide any of the foregoing. Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, and to the extent, the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights and you may also have other legal rights that vary from state to state. \r\n\r\n\r\n12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY \r\n\r\nTHE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF NC INTERACTIVE'S (OR ANY OF ITS SHAREHOLDERS, PARTNERS, AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SUBSIDIARIES, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, LICENSEES OR DISTRIBUTORS) LIABILITY TO YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LOWER OF THE (i) ACCOUNT FEES OR (ii) PURCHASE PRICE OF THE ADDITIONAL FEATURES EACH OF THE FOREGOING (i) OR (ii) AS PAID BY YOU TO NC INTERACTIVE IN THE PRECEDING SIX (6) MONTHS. IN NO EVENT SHALL NC INTERACTIVE, NOR ANY OF ITS CONTENT PROVIDERS, SHAREHOLDERS, PARTNERS, AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR SUPPLIERS, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS), REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (INCLUDING CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR STRICT LIABILITY) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE, THE SOFTWARE, YOUR ACCOUNT OR THIS AGREEMENT WHICH MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, WHETHER OR NOT NC INTERACTIVE (OR ANY SUCH OTHER RELEASED PARTY) MAY HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT ANY SUCH DAMAGES MIGHT OR COULD OCCUR.
